This is a Library webpage I made using HTML, CSS and Javascript, following the assignment of the Library project from "The Odin Project", while doing all the logic and styling by myself.

#Functionalities

- You can add or remove a Book from the Library, visual changes will be done automatically after the action.
- Can check/uncheck the read status and also select the status when adding the book.
